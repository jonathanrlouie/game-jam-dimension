# Bull's Dimensional Maze

## What is this?

Bull's Dimensional Maze is a small game I made for a practice game jam to test my knowledge of how to build a game in Amethyst. The themes were made by my sister and I just ran a script to randomly pick a theme from her pool of themes.

## Theme

OH NO I FELL INTO ANOTHER DIMENSION
